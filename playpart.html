<p>MRS. ALVING. The whole thing burnt!--burnt to the ground!<br>

    REGINA. The basement is still burning.<br>
    
    MRS. ALVING. How is it Oswald doesn't come home? There's nothing to be saved.<br>
    
    REGINA. Should you like me to take down his hat to him?<br>
    
    MRS. ALVING. Has he not even got his hat on?<br>
    
    REGINA. [Pointing to the hall.] No; there it hangs.<br>
    
    MRS. ALVING. Let it be. He must come up now. I shall go and look for him 
    myself. [She goes out through the garden door.]<br>
